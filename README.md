PanicPack is a fast, browser-based packing game made for the B-Prepared Web Hackathon. You have a timer, a pile of chaotic items, and one goal — fit everything into the box before time runs out. 
Built with Phaser, JavaScript, and CSS, with a small config JSON so devs can tweak endings, timer, difficulty and more without touching code.

Drag and throw items into the box before the timer runs out. //you can remove timer in json

Every item has a point value (some positive, some negative).

Your final score determines your ending

The box physics and collisions are handled entirely by Matter.js, so everything settles naturally.

Desktop:

Drag items with the mouse

Drop them inside the box before time hits zero

Mobile:
